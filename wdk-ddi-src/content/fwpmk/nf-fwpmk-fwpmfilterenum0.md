## -description

The **FwpmFilterEnum0** function returns the next page of results from the filter enumerator.

## -parameters

### -param engineHandle [in]

Handle for an open session to the filter engine. Call **[FwpmEngineOpen0](nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineopen0.md)** to open a session to the filter engine.

### -param enumHandle [in]

Handle of a filter enumeration created by a call to **FwpmFilterCreateEnumHandle0**.

### -param numEntriesRequested [in]

The number of filter objects requested.

### -param entries [out]

Addresses of enumeration entries.

### -param numEntriesReturned [out]

The number of filter objects returned.

## -returns

| Return code/value | Description |
|---|---|
| **ERROR_SUCCESS**<br>0 | The filters were enumerated successfully. |
| **FWP_E_\* error code**<br>0x80320001—0x80320039 | A Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) specific error. See [WFP Error Codes](/windows/win32/fwp/wfp-error-codes) for details. |
| **RPC_\* error code**<br>0x80010001—0x80010122 | Failure to communicate with the remote or local firewall engine. |
| **Other NTSTATUS codes** | An error occurred. |

## -remarks

If the *numEntriesReturned* is less than the *numEntriesRequested*, the enumeration is exhausted.

The returned array of entries (but not the individual entries themselves) must be freed by a call to **[FwpmFreeMemory0](nf-fwpmk-fwpmfreememory0.md)**.

A subsequent call using the same enumeration handle will return the next set of items following those in the last output buffer.

**FwpmFilterEnum0** works on a snapshot of the filters taken at the time the enumeration handle was created.

**FwpmFilterEnum0** is a specific implementation of **FwpmFilterEnum**. See [WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows](/windows/desktop/FWP/wfp-version-independent-names-and-targeting-specific-versions-of-windows) for more information.
