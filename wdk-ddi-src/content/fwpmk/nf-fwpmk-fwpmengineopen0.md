# FwpmEngineOpen0 function

## -description

The **FwpmEngineOpen0** function opens a session to the filter engine.

## -parameters

### -param serverName [in, optional]

A pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the standard DNS name of the system on which the session to the filter engine is opened. Callout drivers must specify **NULL** for this parameter.

### -param authnService [in]

The authentication service to use. For a list of valid choices for this parameter, see Authentication-Service Constants in the RPC section in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation. Callout drivers must specify either RPC_C_AUTHN_WINNT or RPC_C_AUTHN_DEFAULT for this parameter.

### -param authIdentity [in, optional]

A pointer to a **SEC_WINNT_AUTH_IDENTITY_W** structure that contains the authentication and authorization credentials for accessing the filter engine. This parameter is ignored when the **FwpmEngineOpen0** function is called from a callout driver. Callout drivers should set this parameter to **NULL**.

### -param session [in, optional]

A pointer to an [FWPM_SESSION0](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff550083(v=vs.85)) structure that defines session-specific parameters for the session being opened. This pointer is optional and can be **NULL**.

### -param engineHandle [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives a handle for the open session to the filter engine.

## -returns

The **FwpmEngineOpen0** function returns one of the following NTSTATUS codes.

| Return code | Description |
|--|--|
| **STATUS_SUCCESS** | A session to the filter engine was successfully opened. The variable pointed to by the _engineHandle_ parameter contains a handle for the open session. |
| **Other NTSTATUS codes** | An error occurred. |

## -remarks

A callout driver calls the **FwpmEngineOpen0** function to open a session to the filter engine. A handle to an open session to the
filter engine is a required parameter to most of the [Windows Filtering Platform management functions](/windows/win32/fwp/fwp-mgmt-functions).

Callout drivers normally do not need to open a session to the filter engine because callout drivers typically do not call any of the [Windows Filtering Platform](/windows/desktop/FWP/windows-filtering-platform-start-page) management functions.

For a callout driver to successfully open a session to the filter engine, the filter engine must be currently running at the time that the callout driver calls the **FwpmEngineOpen0** function. A callout driver can call the [FwpmBfeStateGet0](./nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestateget0.md) function to obtain the current state of the filter engine. Before calling **FwpmBfeStateGet0**, the callout driver must call the [FwpmBfeStateSubscribeChanges0](./nf-fwpmk-fwpmbfestatesubscribechanges0.md) function to register a callback function that will be called whenever there is a change in the state of the filter engine.

After a callout driver has finished accessing the filter engine, it calls the [FwpmEngineClose0](./nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineclose0.md) function to close the open session to the filter engine.

**FwpmEngineOpen0** is a specific version of **FwpmEngineOpen**. See [WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows](/windows/desktop/FWP/wfp-version-independent-names-and-targeting-specific-versions-of-windows) for more information.
