# KeBugCheckEx function


## -description

The <b>KeBugCheckEx</b> routine brings down the system in a controlled manner when the caller discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency that would corrupt the system if the caller continued to run.

## -parameters

### -param BugCheckCode [in]


Specifies a value that indicates the reason for the bug check.

### -param BugCheckParameter1 [in]



### -param BugCheckParameter2 [in]



### -param BugCheckParameter3 [in]



### -param BugCheckParameter4 [in]


The four <i>BugCheckParameterX</i> values supply additional information, such as the address and data where a memory-corruption error occurred, depending on the value of <i>BugCheckCode</i>.

## -remarks

A bug check is a system-detected error that causes an immediate, controlled shutdown of the system. Various kernel-mode components perform run-time consistency checking. When such a component discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency, it causes a bug check to be generated.

Whenever possible, all kernel-mode components should log an error and continue to run, rather than calling <b>KeBugCheckEx</b>. For example, if a driver is unable to allocate required resources, it should log an error so that the system continues to run; it must not generate a bug check.

A driver or other kernel-mode component should call this routine only in cases of a fatal, unrecoverable error that could corrupt the system itself.

<b>KeBugCheckEx</b> can be useful in the early stages of developing a driver, or while it is undergoing testing. In these circumstances, the <i>BugCheckCode</i> passed to this routine should be distinct from those codes already in use by Windows or its drivers. For a list of these codes, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-code-reference2">Bug Check Codes</a>.

However, even during driver development, this routine is of only limited utility, since it results in a complete system shutdown. A more effective debugging method is to attach a kernel debugger to the system and then use routines that send messages to the debugger or break into the debugger. For further information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg--kernel-mode-">Get started with WinDbg (kernel mode)</a>.
