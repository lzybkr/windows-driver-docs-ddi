# RX_CONTEXT structure

## -description

The **RX_CONTEXT** structure encapsulates an IRP for use by RDBSS, network mini-redirectors, and the file system. It describes an IRP while it is being processed by a network mini-redirector and contains state information that allows global resources to be released as the IRP is completed.

## -struct-fields

### -field NodeTypeCode

The unique node type used for an **RX_CONTEXT** structure. RDBSS sets this member to **RDBSS_NTC_RX_CONTEXT** when an **RX_CONTEXT** is initialized in [**RxInitializeContext**](nf-rxcontx-rxinitializecontext). If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an **RX_CONTEXT** structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

All of the major structure types used by RDBSS have a unique two-byte node type code defined in *nodetype.h* that can be used for debugging. These major structure types include the following:

* **RX_CONTEXT**
* [**SRV_CALL**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-srv-call-structure)
* [**NET_ROOT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-net-root-structure)
* [**V_NET_ROOT**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-v-net-root-structure)
* [**SRV_OPEN**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-srv-open-structure)
* [**FCB**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-fcb-structure)
* [**FOBX**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-fobx-structure)

### -field NodeByteSize

The size, in bytes, of this structure. RDBSS sets this member to sizeof( RX_CONTEXT) when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the **RxInitializeContext** routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

### -field ReferenceCount

The reference count for this structure after it is allocated. RDBSS sets this member to 1 when an RX_CONTEXT is allocated and initialized in the **RxInitializeContext** routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

### -field ContextListEntry

The list entry to connect this RX_CONTEXT to the list of active RX_CONTEXTS.

### -field MajorFunction

The major function for the IRP encapsulated by this RX_CONTEXT.

### -field MinorFunction

The minor function for the IRP encapsulated by this RX_CONTEXT.

### -field PendingReturned

If set to TRUE, this specifies that RDBSS or a driver has marked the IRP pending. Each [**IoCompletion**](../wdm/nc-wdm-io_completion_routine.md) routine should check the value of this flag. If the flag is TRUE, and if the **IoCompletion** routine will not return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, the routine should call [**IoMarkIrpPending**](../wdm/nc-wdm-iomarkirppending.md) to propagate the pending status to drivers above it in the device stack. This member is similar to the same field in the IRP.

RDBSS always sets this member to TRUE before calling the network mini-redirector driver.

### -field PostRequest

If set to TRUE, this indicates if the associated request is to be posted to a RDBSS worker thread. A network mini-redirector can set this member to TRUE to indicate that it wants to post this request to the file system process (FSP).

### -field RealDevice

A pointer to the device object for the target network mini-redirector driver. RDBSS sets this member to the device object for the network mini-redirector driver when an RX_CONTEXT is allocated in the [**RxInitializeContext**](nf-rxcontx-rxinitializecontext) routine. This member is copied from the **FileObject->DeviceObject** member from the IRP stack. The device object for the network mini-redirector is also stored in the **RxDeviceObject** structure member.

The **RealDevice**  member is not currently used by RDBSS, but can be used by network mini-redirectors.

### -field CurrentIrp

A pointer to the originating IRP. This member should not be used by a network mini-redirector driver.

### -field CurrentIrpSp

A pointer to the associated non-paged file control block (FCB) for this IRP.

### -field RxDeviceObject

A pointer to the RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT for the target network mini-redirector driver which is required for worker queue algorithms. RDBSS sets this member to the RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT for the network mini-redirector when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the **RxInitializeContext** routine. The **RxDeviceObject** structure includes a **DeviceObject** member that contains the device object for the network mini-redirector driver which is the same as the **RealDevice** member of the RX_CONTEXT.

### -field OriginalThread

A pointer to the original thread in which the request was initiated.

### -field LastExecutionThread

A pointer to the last thread in which some processing associated with the RX_CONTEXT was done if the thread was posted to the file system process.

The serial number for this RX_CONTEXT structure. Every structure initialized by RDBSS has a serial number assigned when the structure is first initialized. This serial number is a number that is incremented by one before the value is set. RDBSS sets this member when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the **RxInitializeContext** routine. RDBSS

### -field FobxSerialNumber

The serial number for the associated FOBX structure. Every structure initialized by RDBSS has a serial number assigned when the structure is first initialized.

### -field FcbPagingIoResourceAcquired

If set to TRUE, this member specifies that the FCB paging I/O resource has been acquired for this operation. The FCB paging I/O resource is one of the locking mechanisms associated with a paging I/O operation on an FCB.

RDBSS sets this member to RDBSS_NTC_RX_CONTEXT when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the [**RxInitializeContext**](nf-rxcontx-rxinitializecontext) routine.

## -remarks

The **RX_CONTEXT** structure is one of the fundamental data structures used by RDBSS and network mini-redirectors to manage an I/O request packet (IRP). It encapsulates an IRP for use by RDBSS, network mini-redirectors, and the file system. An **RX_CONTEXT** structure includes a pointer to a single IRP and all of the context required to process the IRP.

An **RX_CONTEXT** structure is sometimes referred to as an IRP Context or RxContext in the WDK header files and other resources used for developing network mini-redirector drivers.

The **RX_CONTEXT** is a data structure to which additional information provided by the various network mini redirectors is attached. The **RX_CONTEXT** includes fields for over allocating the size of each **RX_CONTEXT** structure by a pre-specified amount for each network mini redirector, which is then reserved for use by the mini redirector. This approach consists of allocating a pre-specified area, which is the same for all network mini redirectors as part of each RX_CONTEXT. This is an unformatted area on top of which any desired structure can be imposed by the various network mini redirectors. Developers of network mini-redirector drivers should try and define the associated private context to fit into this pre-specified area defined in the RX_CONTEXT data structure. Network mini-redirector drivers that violate this rule will incur a significant performance penalty.

Many RDBSS routines and routines exported by a network mini-redirector make reference to RX_CONTEXT structures in either the initiating thread or in some other thread used by the routine. Thus, allocated RX_CONTEXT structures are reference counted to manage their use for asynchronous operations. When the reference count goes to zero, the allocated RX_CONTEXT structure can be finalized and released on the last dereference operation.

RDBSS provides a number of routines that are used to manipulate an RX_CONTEXT and the associated IRP. These routines are used to allocate, initialize, and delete an RX_CONTEXT. These routines are also used to complete the IRP associated with an RX_CONTEXT and set up a cancel routine for an RX_CONTEXT.
