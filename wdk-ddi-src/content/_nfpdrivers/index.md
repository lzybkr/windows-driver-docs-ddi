# Near field communications (NFC)

## -description

Overview of the Near field communications (NFC) technology.

To develop Near field communications (NFC), you need these headers:

 * [nfccx.h](../nfccx/index.md)
 * [nfcradiodev.h](../nfcradiodev/index.md)
 * [nfcsedev.h](../nfcsedev/index.md)
 * [nfpdev.h](../nfpdev/index.md)
 * [winsmcrd.h](../winsmcrd/index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Near field communications (NFC)](/windows-hardware/drivers/nfc).
