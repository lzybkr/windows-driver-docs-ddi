# Power metering

## -description

The Power Meter Interface (PMI) is provided through a WDM driver that services I/O request packets (IRPs) from the Power Manager and the Power WMI Provider component of the [User-Mode Power Service](/windows-hardware/drivers/powermeter/user-mode-power-service) (UMPS).

To develop Power metering, you need these headers:

 * [pmi.h](../pmi/index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Power metering](/windows-hardware/drivers/powermeter).
