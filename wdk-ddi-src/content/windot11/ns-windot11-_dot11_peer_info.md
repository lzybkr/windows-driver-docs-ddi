# _DOT11_PEER_INFO structure


## -description

> [!Important]
> [WiFiCx](/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/wifi-wdf-class-extension-wificx) is the new Wi-Fi driver model released in Windows 11. We recommend that you use WiFiCx to take advantage of the latest features. The WDI driver model is now in maintenance mode and will only receive high priority fixes.

The DOT11_PEER_INFO structure specifies information on a peer station within an independent basic
  service set (IBSS) network.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  IBSS (Ad hoc) and SoftAP are deprecated. Starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, use <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/partnerapps/wi-fi-direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a>.</div><div> </div>

## -struct-fields

### -field MacAddress

The media access control (MAC) address of the peer station within an independent BSS (IBSS)
     network.

### -field usCapabilityInformation

The 802.11 Capability Information field from the beacon or probe response frames that the 802.11
     station most recently received from the peer.

### -field AuthAlgo

The authentication algorithm that the 802.11 station resolved with the peer station during the
     association operation. For more information about the data type for the
     <b>AuthAlgo</b> member, see
     <a href="..\wlantypes\ne-wlantypes-_dot11_auth_algorithm.md">DOT11_AUTH_ALGORITHM</a>.


This member is not defined if the peer is not associated.

### -field UnicastCipherAlgo

The unicast cipher algorithm that the 802.11 station resolved with the peer station during the
     association operation. For more information about the data type for the
     <b>UnicastCipherAlgo</b> member, see
     <a href="..\wlantypes\ne-wlantypes-_dot11_cipher_algorithm.md">DOT11_CIPHER_ALGORITHM</a>.


This member is not defined if the peer is not associated.

### -field MulticastCipherAlgo

The multicast cipher algorithm that the 802.11 station resolved with the peer station during the
     association operation. For more information about the data type for the
     <b>MulticastCipherAlgo</b> member, see
     <a href="..\wlantypes\ne-wlantypes-_dot11_cipher_algorithm.md">DOT11_CIPHER_ALGORITHM</a>.


This member is not defined if the peer is not associated.

### -field bWpsEnabled

A Boolean value that indicates whether WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is enabled for the peer station.
     If <b>TRUE</b>, WPS is enabled, and the authentication and cipher algorithms that are used by the peer might be
     different from the algorithms that are enabled on the AP.


This member should not be used if the peer is not associated.

### -field usListenInterval

A USHORT value that defines the 802.11 Listen Interval field that was obtained from the
     association request.


This member has a value of zero if the peer is not associated.

### -field ucSupportedRates

A UCHAR value that specifies the data rates supported by the peer station. These rates are based
     on the 802.11 Supported Rates IE from the beacon or probe response frames that the 802.11 station most
     recently received from the peer.


Each entry in the
     <b>ucPeerSupportedRates</b> array is the value of an index within the table of data rates returned
     through a query of
     <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-dot11-data-rate-mapping-table">
     OID_DOT11_DATA_RATE_MAPPING_TABLE</a>. The index value must be between 2 and 127.

This member has a value of zero if the peer is not associated.

### -field usAssociationID

A USHORT value that specifies the 802.11 Association ID field from the association or
     re-association response frames that the 802.11 station received from the AP.


This member has a value of 0xFFFF if the peer is not associated.

### -field AssociationState

A
     <a href="..\windot11\ne-windot11-_dot11_association_state.md">DOT11_ASSOCIATION_STATE</a>-type value
     that indicates the 802.11 authentication and association state of the peer station. The state can be
     either
     <b>dot11_assoc_state_auth_unassoc</b> or
     <b>dot11_assoc_state_auth_assoc</b>.


In the
     <i>IEEE 802.11 Standard</i>, the 802.11 authentication procedure is optional for an independent network.
     Therefore, depending upon the IHV implementation, the state represented by the
     <b>dot11_assoc_state_auth_unassoc</b> enumeration value may not be applicable.

### -field PowerMode

A
     <a href="..\windot11\ne-windot11-_dot11_power_mode.md">DOT11_POWER_MODE</a>-type value that describes
     the latest power management mode of the peer station.

### -field liAssociationUpTime

A LARGEINTEGER value that specifies the timestamp when the 802.11 association procedure successfully
     completed. The miniport driver calls
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisgetcurrentsystemtime.md">NdisGetCurrentSystemTime</a> to get
     the timestamp of the association completion.


This member has a value of zero if the peer is not associated.

### -field Statistics

The statistics counters for data traffic, defined by the
     <a href="..\windot11\ns-windot11-_dot11_peer_statistics.md">DOT11_PEER_STATISTICS</a> structure.


This member has a value of zero if the peer is not associated.
