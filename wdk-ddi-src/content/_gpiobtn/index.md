# Hardware notifications

## -description

Windows provides an infrastructure for the hardware-agnostic support of notification components such as LEDs and vibration mechanisms. This support is delivered through the introduction of a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) class extension specifically for hardware notification components that allows for the rapid development of client drivers. A KMDF class extension is essentially a KMDF driver that provides a defined set of functionality for a given class of devices, similar to a port driver in the Windows Driver Model (WDM). This section provides an overview of the architecture of the hardware notification class extension. 

For additional information about the KMDF, see [Using WDF to Develop a Driver](/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-the-framework-to-develop-a-driver).

To provide support for hardware notifications, you need:
