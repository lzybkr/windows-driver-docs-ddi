# D3DKMT_ENUMADAPTERS3 structure

## -description

The **D3DKMT_ENUMADAPTERS3** structure supplies information about adapters on the system.

## -struct-fields

### -field Filter [in]

A **D3DKMT_ENUMADAPTERS_FILTER** union containing filter flags for the enumeration. The struct in **Filter** can be a bitwise OR of the following values. See Remarks for more information.

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| IncludeComputeOnly    | When set, enumerate ComputeOnly adapters. |
| IncludeDisplayOnly    | When set, enumerate DisplayOnly adapters. |
| IncludeVirtualGpuOnly | When set, enumerate GPU-P adapters. These adapters are meant to be used only inside virtual machines. A driver sets the [**DXGK_DRIVERCAPS**](..//d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps.md)**::MiscCaps.VirtualGpuOnly** cap for such adapters to avoid their enumeration in the host OS. Available starting in Windows 11, version 24H2 (WDDM 3.2). |
| Reserved              | Reserved; do not use.                     |

### -field NumAdapters [in/out]

The number of adapters.

On input, **NumAdapters** specifies how many adapters can be returned in the empty **pAdapters** array. Possible return values for **NumAdapters** are:

- On successful return when **pAdapters** is non-null, **NumAdapters** contains how many adapters were returned in the **pAdapters** array.
- On successful return when **pAdapters** is null, **NumAdapters** contains the maximum supported adapter count.
- On failed return when **pAdapters** is non-null, **NumAdapters** is undefined.

### -field pAdapters [out]

An optional array of [**D3DKMT_ADAPTERINFO**](ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_adapterinfo.md) structures in which to receive information for each adapter.

## -remarks

Adapters will still be enumerated if no flags are set in **Filter**, but [**D3DKMTEnumAdapters3**](nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtenumadapters3.md) will enumerate fewer adapters than [**D3DKMTEnumAdapters2**](nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtenumadapters2.md). Specifically, **D3DKMTEnumAdapters3** will:

- Leave out ComputeOnly adapters from the default enumeration, to avoid breaking applications.
- Leave out DisplayOnly adapters from the default enumeration.
