# Human Interface Devices (HID)

## -description

Overview of the Human Interface Devices (HID) technology.

To develop Human Interface Devices (HID), you need these headers:

- [hidclass.h](../hidclass/index.md)
- [hidpddi.h](../hidpddi/index.md)
- [hidpi.h](../hidpi/index.md)
- [hidport.h](../hidport/index.md)
- [hidsdi.h](../hidsdi/index.md)
- [hidspicx.h](../hidspicx/index.md)
- [kbdmou.h](../kbdmou/index.md)
- [ntdd8042.h](../ntdd8042/index.md)
- [vhf.h](../vhf/index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Human Interface Devices (HID)](/windows-hardware/drivers/hid).

For Win32 HID programming APIs, see [Win32 Human Interface Devices Reference](/windows/win32/api/_hid/).

This section contains the programming interfaces related to Human Interface Devices (or HID). Typically, these are devices that humans use to directly control the operation of computer systems.

## HIDClass Support Routines

There are system-supplied routines that user-mode applications, kernel-mode drivers, and HID minidrivers use to operate devices in the HIDClass device setup class.

As a general rule, user-mode applications can use the HidD_Xxx and HidP_Xxx routines. However, kernel-mode drivers can only call HidP_Xxx routines.

HID minidrivers use only the **HidRegisterMinidriver** routine.

For Windows 8.1 Microsoft introduced the new Windows.Devices.HumanInterfaceDevice API which lets you write Windows apps that access HID devices.

The header defines IOCTLs that a HID minidriver must support. Only the HID class driver sends these IOCTLs to a HID minidriver. User-mode applications and other kernel-mode drivers can only communicate with HID collections by using the HIDClass support routines and HID class driver IOCTLs.

## HID Minidriver IOCTLs

A HID minidriver must handle a set of IOCTLs. Only the HID class driver sends these IOCTLs to a HID minidriver. User-mode applications and other kernel-mode drivers can only communicate with HID collections by using the HIDClass support routines and HID class driver IOCTLs.

|Topic | Description |
|---|---|
|IOCTL_HID_ACTIVATE_DEVICE| The IOCTL_HID_ACTIVATE_DEVICE request activates a HIDClass device, which makes it ready for I/O operations.|
|IOCTL_HID_DEACTIVATE_DEVICE| The IOCTL_HID_DEACTIVATE_DEVICE request deactivates a HIDClass device, which causes it to stop operations and terminate all outstanding I/O requests.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES| The IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES request obtains a HIDClass device's attributes in a HID_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES structure.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR| The IOCTL_HID_GET_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR request obtains a HIDClass device's HID descriptor.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR| The IOCTL_HID_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR request obtains the report descriptor for a HIDClass device.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_STRING| The IOCTL_HID_GET_STRING request obtains a manufacturer ID, product ID, or serial number for a top-level collection. The retrieved string is a NULL-terminated wide character string in a human-readable format.|
|IOCTL_HID_READ_REPORT| The IOCTL_HID_READ_REPORT request transfers an input report from a HIDClass device into the HID class driver's buffer.|
|IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT| The IOCTL_HID_WRITE_REPORT request sends a HID report to a HIDClass device.|
|IOCTL_UMDF_GET_PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTOR| The IOCTL_UMDF_GET_PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTOR control code obtains the physical descriptor of a HIDClass device.|

|IOCTL_UMDF_HID_SET_OUTPUT_REPORT| The IOCTL_UMDF_HID_SET_OUTPUT_REPORT control code sends an output report to a top-level collection.|

## HID Class Driver IOCTLs

The HID class driver handles IOCTLs to support for top-level collections.

Although user applications can communicate with the HID class driver by using HidD_Xxx  HIDClass support routines, kernel-mode drivers must send the corresponding device control requests described in this section.

The input and output parameters are request-specific.

Upon completion of a request, the I/O status block members are set as follows:

The **Status** member is set by the HID class driver for all requests that it handles.

As described for each IOCTL, the Information member is set either by the class driver or a lower-level driver. Normally, when a lower-level driver transfers data from or to a device, the lower-level driver sets Information to the number of bytes transferred. However, the HID class driver might return a different value.

|Topic | Description |

|IOCTL_HID_DISABLE_SECURE_READ | The IOCTL_HID_DISABLE_SECURE_READ request cancels an IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_SECURE_READ request for a HID collection.|
|IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_SECURE_READ | The IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_SECURE_READ request enables a secure read for open files of a HID collection.|
|IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_WAKE_ON_SX | The IOCTL_HID_ENABLE_WAKE_ON_SX request is used to indicate the requirement for a device to be able to wake from system sleep.|
|IOCTL_HID_FLUSH_QUEUE| The IOCTL_HID_FLUSH_QUEUE request dequeues all of the unparsed input reports from a top-level collection's input report queue. |
|IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_DESCRIPTOR| The IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_DESCRIPTOR request obtains a top-level collection's preparsed data, which the HID class driver extracted from the physical device's report descriptor during device initialization.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_INFORMATION| The IOCTL_HID_GET_COLLECTION_INFORMATION request obtains a top-level collection's HID_COLLECTION_INFORMATION structure.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_DRIVER_CONFIG| The IOCTL_HID_GET_DRIVER_CONFIG request retrieves the driver configuration.|

|IOCTL_HID_GET_MANUFACTURER_STRING | The IOCTL_HID_GET_MANUFACTURER_STRING request obtains a top-level collection's embedded string that identifies the manufacturer of the device.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_MS_GENRE_DESCRIPTOR | The IOCTL_HID_GET_MS_GENRE_DESCRIPTOR request is used for retrieving the genre descriptor for the device.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_POLL_FREQUENCY_MSEC | The IOCTL_HID_GET_POLL_FREQUENCY_MSEC request obtains the current polling frequency, in milliseconds, of a top-level collection.|
|IOCTL_HID_GET_PRODUCT_STRING| The IOCTL_HID_GET_PRODUCT_STRING request obtains a top-level collection's embedded string that identifies the manufacturer's product. The retrieved string is a NULL-terminated wide character string in a human-readable format. For general information about HIDClass devices, see HID Collections.
|IOCTL_HID_GET_SERIALNUMBER_STRING| The IOCTL_HID_GET_SERIALNUMBER_STRING request obtains a top-level collection's embedded string that identifies the device's serial number.|
|IOCTL_HID_SET_DRIVER_CONFIG| The IOCTL_HID_SET_DRIVER_CONFIG request sets the driver configuration.|
|IOCTL_HID_SET_FEATURE| The IOCTL_HID_SET_FEATURE request sends a feature report to a top-level collection. For general information about HIDClass devices, see HID Collections. |
|IOCTL_HID_SET_OUTPUT_REPORT| The IOCTL_HID_SET_OUTPUT_REPORT request sends an output report to a top-level collection.|
|IOCTL_HID_SET_POLL_FREQUENCY_MSEC| The IOCTL_HID_SET_POLL_FREQUENCY_MSEC request sets the polling frequency, in milliseconds, for a top-level collection. User-mode applications or kernel-mode drivers that perform irregular, opportunistic reads on a polled device must furnish a polling interval of zero. In such cases, IOCTL_HID_SET_POLL_FREQUENCY_MSEC does not actually change the polling frequency of the device; but if the report data is not stale when it is read, the read is completed immediately with the latest report data for the indicated collection. If the report data is stale, it is refreshed immediately, without waiting for the expiration of the polling interval, and the read is completed with the new data. If the value for the polling interval that is provided in the IRP is not zero, it must be >= MIN_POLL_INTERVAL_MSEC and <= MAX_POLL_INTERVAL_MSEC. Polling may be limited if there are multiple top-level collections. For general information about HIDClass devices, see HID Collections. |
|IOCTL_HID_SET_S0_IDLE_TIMEOUT| The IOCTL_HID_SET_S0_IDLE_TIMEOUT request is used by a client to inform the HID class driver about the client's preferred idle timeout value.|
|IOCTL_SET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS| The IOCTL_SET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS request sets the number of buffers for the input report queue of a top-level collection. Each input report queue is implemented as a ring buffer. If a collection transmits data to the HID class driver faster than the driver can read it, some of the data may be lost. To prevent this type of loss, you can use an IOCTL_SET_NUM_DEVICE_INPUT_BUFFERS request to adjust the number of buffers that the input report queue contains. The HID class driver requires a minimum of two input buffers. The maximum number of input buffers that the HID class driver supports is 512. The default number of input buffers is 32. For general information about HIDClass devices, see HID Collections. |
