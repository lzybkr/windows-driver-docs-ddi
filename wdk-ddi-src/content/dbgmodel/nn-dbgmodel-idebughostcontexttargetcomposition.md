## -description

An interface which bridges the extensibility of the upper edge interfaces (the data model) with those of the lower edge (target composition) for a particular host context.

For a debug host which supports both layers, this interface can be QI'd off any host context.

## -inheritance

IDebugHostContextTargetComposition inherits from IUnknown.

## -remarks

This and IDebugHostSymbolsTargetComposition are optional Bridge Interfaces to Target Composition Interfaces.

A debug host which only supports the data model layer need not support any of these interfaces.  A debug host which supports both the data model layer and target composition layer of extensibility supports these to bridge between the two layers.
