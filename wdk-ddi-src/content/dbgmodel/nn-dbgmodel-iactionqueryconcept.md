## -description

A concept which is automatically implemented by the data model for any object which has (or can have) actions
on it.  The enumerator returned from this concept will aggregate all actions implemented via metadata keys on
 methods and those implemented via direct support of IActionableConcept anywhere on the object.

Clients should *NEVER* implement this concept -- only query for it.

## -inheritance

IActionQueryConcept inherits from IUnknown.
